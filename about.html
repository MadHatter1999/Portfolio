        <!--Why i started-->
          <h3 class="text-center">Why Programming</h3>
          <p>
            My Intrest with computers started in elementary school. My house had gotten a desktop
            and I remember most mornings I woke up early to try and figure out how I could use that
            machine and what I could use it for. Ever since then, I have been always eager to figure 
            out how things work, and with programming, I believe I can achieve this goal since there 
            is always something we can tweak.

          <!--How to get there-->
          <h4 class="text-center">Plans to get there</h4>
          <p>
            I plan on achieving these goals by working hard and do my absolute best, Staying Determined to hit goals and milestones.
            I know these goals are big, but I would say with hard work and making it a team effort would be a big help. 
            I would also say a lot of networking still needs to be done if I wish to achieve my own business but I am confident in the 
            people I surround myself with to have interest in helping me along if I do get stuck
